Invoice Processing Platform - Strategic Plan
Two-Sided Market Strategy: Accountants → Restaurants
Last Updated: November 2024
Version: 2.0 (Accounting-First Strategy)

🎯 CORE INSIGHT
Restaurant accountants process invoices weekly as part of their bookkeeping job. By building tools for accountants FIRST, we automatically populate restaurant databases with zero effort from restaurant owners. This solves the #1 adoption barrier in restaurant management software.

💡 THE STRATEGY
Phase 1: Launch for Accountants (Months 1-6)
Target Customer: Accounting firms / bookkeepers serving restaurants
Value Proposition: "Process restaurant invoices 15x faster with AI extraction. Automatic export to QuickBooks/Xero."
Product: Invoice processing only

Upload invoices (photo/PDF/email)
AI extraction (vendor, date, items, prices, totals, tax)
QuickBooks/Xero integration
Client management (one account serves multiple restaurants)
Accuracy review/correction interface

Pricing: $299/month per accounting firm
Sales Approach: "Show-it" product

30-second demo with real invoice
Instant ROI visualization (190 hours saved/month)
No complex pitch needed

Goal: 10 accounting firms = $3k MRR (processing invoices for 200+ restaurants)

Phase 2: Upsell to Restaurants (Months 6-12)
Target Customer: Restaurants whose accountants use the platform
Value Proposition: "Your accountant already processes your invoices through us. Your ingredient database is already built and updated weekly. Add recipe costing for $99/month—zero data entry required."
Product: Recipe management features

Recipe CRUD operations
Cost calculator (using data accountant already entered)
Portion scaling
Voice input
Menu profitability analysis
Ingredient lifecycle tracking

Pricing:

$99/month per restaurant (add-on to accountant tier)
$149/month standalone (if restaurant wants direct access without accountant)

Sales Approach: Zero-friction adoption

Database is pre-built by accountant
No manual data entry required
Just "turn on" recipe features
Easy yes because setup is already done

Goal: 50 restaurants = $5k MRR
Total Phase 2 MRR: $8k ($3k accountants + $5k restaurants)

Phase 3: Scale Both Sides (Months 12-24)
Target:

50 accounting firms × $299 = $15k MRR
500 restaurants × $99 = $49.5k MRR
Total: $64.5k MRR = $774k ARR


🔄 NETWORK EFFECTS
The Flywheel:
1. Sign one accountant ($299/month)
   ↓
2. Accountant processes invoices for 20 restaurant clients
   ↓
3. Ingredient databases build automatically for those 20 restaurants
   ↓
4. Upsell recipe features to 10 of them ($99/month each = $990)
   ↓
5. Those restaurants refer friends/competitors
   ↓
6. New restaurants ask their accountants to use platform
   ↓
7. Sign more accountants
   ↓
REPEAT (accelerating growth)
Result: Each accountant relationship is worth $1,300-1,800/month in potential revenue

💪 COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES
vs. MarginEdge, PlateIQ, ChefTec:

Distribution Channel: We sell through accountants who become our sales force
Zero Setup Friction: Restaurant databases build automatically (accountants do the work)
Two Revenue Streams: Same technology generates revenue from both sides
Network Effects: More accountants → more restaurants, more restaurants → more accountants
Lower CAC: One accountant sale = 20+ potential restaurant customers
Higher Retention: Accountants won't switch (workflow dependent), restaurants won't switch (no effort to use)

Competitors sell direct-to-restaurant:

Low adoption (<5%)
One revenue stream
High CAC
No network effects

We sell through accountants:

Zero friction (automatic setup)
High adoption (no effort required)
Two revenue streams
Low CAC (accountants bring restaurants)
Compounding network effects
