## Executive Summary

Professional cook with 25 years of commercial kitchen experience transitioning into food-tech entrepreneurship. After completing an AEC in Analyst Programming (C#) at age 37, built a complete catering management system (GiantChef) while still working full-time as a cook—2 years of coding by night, cooking by day. Returned to full-time cooking for a decade to deeply understand why restaurant software fails. Now leveraging AI-assisted development to build a two-sided platform targeting accountants first, then restaurants, solving the $1B+ restaurant profitability problem through automated invoice processing and recipe costing.

## Professional Background

### Cooking Career (25 Years)
- **Restaurants:** Full commercial kitchen experience
- **Catering/Gatherings:** Event-based cooking and service

## Current Mission: Two-Sided Platform Strategy

### The Problem
- **Restaurants:** Don't track ingredient costs accurately, kill profitability through ignorance
- **Accountants:** Waste 8+ hours/week manually processing restaurant invoices
- **Current Solutions:** All require restaurants to do data entry (8-10 hours setup) → zero adoption

### The Breakthrough Insight
**Target accountants FIRST, not restaurants.**

Accountants already visit restaurants weekly to process invoices for bookkeeping. By building invoice processing tools for accountants, restaurant ingredient databases build automatically—with zero effort from restaurant owners. This solves the #1 adoption barrier in restaurant software.

### Phase 1: Accountant Market (Months 1-6)
- **Target:** Restaurant accountants and bookkeepers
- **Pricing:** $299/month per accountant
- **Value Prop:** AI processes restaurant invoices 15x faster (save 190 hours/month)
- **Product Nature:** "Show-it" not "sell-it" (30-second demo proves ROI)
- **Distribution:** One accountant serves 20+ restaurant clients
- **Tech:** AI-powered invoice extraction → QuickBooks/Xero integration

### Phase 2: Restaurant Upsell (Months 6-12)
- **Target:** Restaurants whose accountants already use the platform
- **Pricing:** $99/month per restaurant
- **Value Prop:** Recipe costing with zero data entry (database already built)
- **Upsell Message:** "Your accountant already processes your invoices through us, want recipe costing?"
- **Network Effects:** Each accountant relationship = potential for 10-20 restaurant upsells

### The Genius of This Model
1. **Zero friction for restaurants:** No setup, no data entry required
2. **Accountants become sales force:** They introduce restaurants to the platform
3. **Database builds automatically:** Invoice processing creates the ingredient price database
4. **Two revenue streams:** From same underlying technology
5. **Network effects:** More accountants → more restaurants → more accountants
6. **Show-it product:** 30-second demo to accountants proves immediate value

### Competitive Advantages vs. MarginEdge/PlateIQ/ChefTec
- **Unique distribution channel:** Sell through accountants (competitors don't)
- **Zero setup friction:** vs. 8-10 hours manual setup
- **Two revenue streams:** From same technology stack
- **Network effects:** Competitors have none
- **Lower CAC:** One accountant = 20+ restaurant customers
- **Show-it product:** vs. complex sales cycles

### Unit Economics
- **Accountant:** $299/month revenue, $14k/month value (time saved), <1 month payback, $10,764 LTV
- **Restaurant:** $99/month revenue, $50 CAC (warm intro), <1 month payback, $2,970 LTV
- **Combined (1 accountant + 10 restaurants):** $1,289 MRR, $40,464 total LTV

### Market Opportunity
- **Accountants:** 50,000+ accounting firms serving restaurants
- **Restaurants:** 600,000+ independent restaurants
- **TAM:** $1.8B+ addressable market

### 12-Month Milestones
- **Month 1-2:** Build accounting MVP
- **Month 3-4:** First 3 accountants ($900 MRR)
- **Month 5-6:** 10 accountants ($3k MRR), 2,000+ invoices/month processed
- **Month 7-9:** Build recipe features
- **Month 10-12:** 50 restaurants ($5k MRR), total $8k MRR
- **Month 12-24:** 50 accountants + 500 restaurants = $64.5k MRR ($774k ARR)

## Strategic Insights & Key Learnings

### The Big Pivot: Accountants First
**Before:** Target restaurants directly → Face 8-10 hour setup barrier → Zero adoption  
**After:** Target accountants first → They do the data entry as part of their job → Restaurants get benefit with zero effort

**Why This Works:**
1. Accountants already visit restaurants weekly
2. They already process invoices (that's their job)
3. AI makes their job 15x faster (immediate ROI)
4. Restaurant database builds automatically as byproduct
5. Easy upsell to restaurants: "Your accountant already uses us"
6. One accountant = 20+ restaurant relationships

### Understanding Market Entry
- **"Show-it" vs. "Sell-it":** Invoice processing is show-it (30-second demo proves value)
- **Network effects matter:** Each accountant relationship multiplies reach
- **Distribution > Product:** Unique distribution channel beats better technology
- **Adoption barrier is everything:** Best product loses if adoption is hard
- **Follow the money trail:** Accountants touch restaurant financials weekly

### Why Modern AI Changes Everything
- **Speed to MVP:** Built in 30 hours what would have taken months before
- **Domain expertise matters more:** Technical skills can be augmented, domain knowledge cannot
- **Vibe coding works:** AI tools + clear vision = functional software
- **Competitive advantage:** Moving faster than traditionally-funded startups
- **Proves capability:** Working prototype demonstrates I can ship

### Lessons from GiantChef
- **Real-world usage proves value:** Hundreds of PDFs generated = actual adoption
- **Complex systems are possible:** 20+ table database, multi-window UI, production workflows
- **Building ≠ Understanding:** Built GiantChef but realized I needed to understand problems deeper
- **Patience pays off:** 10 more years in kitchens revealed why software fails
- **The problem is adoption, not features:** Restaurants have solutions available—they just won't use them
