## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records capture important technical decisions made during development.
Each ADR documents the context, decision, rationale, and consequences.

See [Michael Nygard's article](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) for the format origin.
