**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-01-30
**Source:** init (auto-generated from git history)

## Context
The project needed a more comprehensive documentation solution that could handle different types of documentation needs.

## Decision
Added a Documentalist agent with 4 different modes to handle various documentation scenarios and requirements.

## Rationale
Different documentation needs require different approaches, and a multi-mode system provides flexibility while maintaining consistency.

## Alternatives Considered
Single-purpose documentation tools or manual documentation processes could have been used.

## Consequences
- **Positive:** Comprehensive documentation coverage with specialized handling for different content types and use cases.
- **Negative:** Increased system complexity with multiple operational modes to configure and maintain.
