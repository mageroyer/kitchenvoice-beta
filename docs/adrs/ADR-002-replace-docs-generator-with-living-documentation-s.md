# ADR-002: Replace docs-generator with Living Documentation System

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-01-29
**Source:** init (auto-generated from git history)

## Context
The initial docs-generator agent was insufficient for maintaining comprehensive and up-to-date project documentation.

## Decision
Replaced the docs-generator agent with a more sophisticated codebase-mapper agent that creates living documentation.

## Rationale
Living documentation that automatically updates with code changes provides more accurate and useful documentation than static generation.

## Alternatives Considered
Keeping the original docs-generator or manual documentation processes were options.

## Consequences
- **Positive:** Documentation stays automatically synchronized with codebase changes and provides better architectural insights.
- **Negative:** More complex documentation system requires additional maintenance and monitoring.
