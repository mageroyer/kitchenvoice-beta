# ADR-001: Implement AI Autopilot System for Automated Development

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-01-28
**Source:** init (auto-generated from git history)

## Context
The development team needed a way to automate routine code maintenance and documentation tasks to improve development velocity.

## Decision
Implemented an AI Autopilot system that can autonomously perform code maintenance, testing, and documentation generation through specialized agents.

## Rationale
Automation of repetitive development tasks would free up developer time for higher-value work and ensure consistent code quality and documentation.

## Alternatives Considered
Manual development processes or traditional CI/CD without AI assistance were considered.

## Consequences
- **Positive:** Reduced manual overhead for code maintenance and documentation generation with automated quality checks.
- **Negative:** Added complexity to the CI/CD pipeline and dependency on AI services for development workflows.
